   Goal: Create a 3-tier system (e.g., High, Medium, Low risk)
   How: Use thresholds for induction time, precipitation rate, or % supersaturation loss
   Why it’s useful: Helps formulators quickly identify risky APIs

**Build a Visual Dashboard**
   Tool: Spotfire or Python 
   Include:
   • Histograms of induction time
   • Heatmaps of media vs. form vs. polymer
   • Scatterplots: supersaturation vs. time to crash

**Correlate with Physicochemical Properties**
   Use: LogP, MW, pKa, H-bond donors/acceptors, Tm, PSA
   Method: Regression, correlation matrices, or clustering

**Rank-Order Polymer Performance**
   Goal: Rank polymers based on their ability to inhibit crystallization
   How: Calculate Δinduction time or ΔAUC vs. control

**Cluster Compounds by Behavior**
   Tool: K-means or hierarchical clustering
   Inputs: Precipitation rate, induction time, polymer sensitivity

**Develop a Crystallization Tendency Index (CTI)**
   Composite Score: Weighted average of precipitation onset, rate, and extent

**Build a Predictive Model**
   Model Types: Logistic regression, decision trees, or Random Forest
   Target: Will a compound crash out in 30 minutes?

**Create a Formulation Design Matrix**
   Match: Compound CTI + Solubility class + pKa with recommended polymer/media

**Publish Internal White Paper or Poster**
   Title Idea: “Crystallization Risk Profiling Across 90 Compounds: A Data-Driven Strategy for Early-Phase Formulation”
